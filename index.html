                        Fortnite is an online video game and game platform developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in
                        six
                        distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite Battle Royale,
                        a
                        free-to-play battle royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; Fortnite: Save the
                        World, a cooperative hybrid tower defense-shooter and survival game in which up to four players fight off
                        zombie-like
                        creatures and defend objects with traps and fortifications they can build; Fortnite Creative, in which players are
                        given
                        complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas; Lego Fortnite, an open world survival game; Rocket Racing, a
                        racing
                        game; and Fortnite Festival, a rhythm game.
                    
                        Save the World and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was released on
                        December
                        6, 2018. While the Save the World and Creative versions have been successful for Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale
                        in
                        particular became an overwhelming success and a cultural phenomenon, drawing more than 125 million players in less
                        than
                        a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month. Fortnite as a whole generated $9 billion in gross revenue
                        up
                        until December 2019, and it has been listed among the greatest games of all time.
