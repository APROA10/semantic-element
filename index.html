                        Diwali is connected to various religious events, deities and personalities, such as being the day Rama returned to his
                        kingdom in Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after defeating the demon king Ravana.[15] It is also
                        widely associated with Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity, and Ganesha, the god of wisdom and the remover of
                        obstacles.[16] Other regional traditions connect the holiday to Vishnu, Krishna, Durga, Shiva, Kali, Hanuman, Kubera,
                        Yama, Yami, Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman.
                        
                        Primarily a Hindu festival, variations of Diwali are also celebrated by adherents of other faiths.[13] The Jains observe
                        their own Diwali which marks the final liberation of Mahavira.[17][18] The Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas to mark the
                        release of Guru Hargobind from a Mughal prison.[19] Newar Buddhists, unlike other Buddhists, celebrate Diwali by
                        worshipping Lakshmi, while the Hindus of Eastern India and Bangladesh generally celebrate Diwali by worshipping the
                        goddess Kali.[20][2][2
